# Board command compatibility

| Capability | Command kind | TutorBoard reader | Server reader |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base board editing | Existing `core.*` command set | 0.1.0+ | board/v1 |
| Atomic Smart Ink acceptance | `core.objects.replace` | This release+ | board/v1 with replace support |
| Semantic 3D solids | `core.solid-3d.*` | BoardDocument 1.3+ | board/v1.3 reader |
| 3D learning attempts | `core.solid-3d-learning.*` | BoardDocument 1.4+ | board/v1.4 reader |
| Media asset references | object-bearing `core.*` commands | BoardDocument 1.5+ | board/v1.5 reader; persistence gated until media authority |
| Single-tap ink dots | `drawing.pen-stroke` with one Vector Ink sample | BoardDocument 1.6+ | board/v1.6 reader |
| Atomic mixed erasing | `core.objects.rewrite` | BoardCommandEnvelope 1.7+ | board/v1.7 reader |

`core.objects.replace` carries complete original and replacement snapshots.
Older strict readers reject this command explicitly. Deployments using server
sync must update the board/v1 reader before enabling Smart Ink for shared
boards. `media.asset` metadata is contract-readable in this release, while
server persistence rejects it until board media authority is deployed.
